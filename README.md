# 🌦️ HK Weather Data Analysis

## 📘 Introduction
This project explores **Hong Kong’s weather data** from **1990 to 2025** using the **Meteostat API**.  
The main goal is to study **temperature trends** and **seasonal changes** over the years — to see if Hong Kong has been getting warmer and how its seasons have shifted.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview
This notebook focuses on **long-term weather changes in Hong Kong** by analyzing historical daily data.  
It uses Python to collect, clean, and visualize weather patterns — mainly temperature — to understand possible climate changes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Retrieve daily weather data for Hong Kong (1990–2025)  
- Analyze **average temperature trends** over time  
- Compare **seasonal differences** (winter vs. summer)  
- Visualize findings with **graphs and simple statistics**

---

## 🌍 Data Source
All weather data is retrieved from the **[Meteostat API](https://meteostat.net/)**, which provides free access to historical weather data from various meteorological stations.

---

## 🧮 Methodology
1. Import required Python libraries  
2. Define the location ID for Hong Kong (`location_id = '45007'`)  
3. Fetch daily weather data from 1990–2025  
4. Store it in a Pandas DataFrame  
5. Plot and analyze trends in average temperature and seasons

---

## ❓ Key Questions

1. Has the average temperature in Hong Kong increased over time?
2. Have the seasons (winter, summer, etc.) changed in duration or temperature?
3. Are there any other patterns or unusual changes visible in the data?

## 📊 Findings and Insights
| Question | Summary of Findings |
|----------|----------|
| **Q1: Temperature trends** | The average temperature shows a slight upward trend, suggesting gradual warming over the years. |
| **Q2: Seasonal changes** | Winters appear shorter and warmer, while summers seem longer and slightly hotter. |
| **Q3: Other observations** | There are small yearly fluctuations, but the overall pattern suggests climate warming in Hong Kong. |

## 🏁 Conclusion

From the analysis, Hong Kong shows signs of gradual warming since 1990.
Seasonal temperature differences have reduced — winters are less cold, and summers are more intense.
These findings align with broader climate change trends observed globally.
